## 📌 What are Trust Tasks?

**Trust Tasks** are simple, required assignments that every member must complete before the weekly deadline.

These tasks are **not about testing your skill level**, but rather:
- Your **commitment** to the project.
- Your ability to **follow instructions**.
- Your **seriousness** in task delivery.

They help us identify who is genuinely ready to contribute to the EduLite project.

## 🔍 Where to find your task?

Each task is tailored based on your specialization.

Go to the folder that matches your role:
```
├── frontend/
├── backend/
├── ui-ux/
└── design/
```


Inside your folder, you will find:
- 📄 A document explaining **your specific task**.
- 🛠️ Instructions on **how to solve it step-by-step**.
- 🧰 Tools and technologies you’re expected to use.

> Example: If you're a frontend developer, go to `/frontend/` and follow the instructions inside.

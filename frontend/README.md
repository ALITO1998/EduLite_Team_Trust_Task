# 🎨 Frontend Trust Task – CRUD UI Challenge

Welcome to the frontend track of **EduLite’s Trust Tasks**!

This task will test your ability to build clean, modern, and functional UIs that interact with a RESTful API.  
You **don’t need to build a backend** — the API is already available and fully documented.

---

## 📌 Task Description

You are required to:

- Build a complete **CRUD web interface** that interacts with the provided RESTful API.
- The interface must allow users to:
  - **Create** new entries  
  - **Read** all entries  
  - **Update** existing entries  
  - **Delete** entries
- Your UI must be **fully functional**, **modern in design**, and **responsive**.
- The design must **reflect real-world application standards**.

---

## 🧩 Tools and Requirements

You must use:

- **React** for frontend logic.  
- **HTML + CSS** or any CSS framework (e.g. Tailwind, Bootstrap).  
- **fetch** or **axios** to communicate with the API.  
- Any design that makes the experience smooth and intuitive.

💡 *Think of it as a small admin dashboard — clean, elegant, and easy to use.*

## 🌐 API Reference

The API you will be working with is already deployed and documented.

👉 **[View API Documentation Here](https://github.com/ibrahim-sisar/EduLite_Team_Trust_Task/blob/main/frontend/API_DOCUMENTATION.md)**

- The API supports all CRUD operations.
- You do **not** need to implement login or authentication.
- All data is **publicly accessible** for this task.

## 🛠️ How to Start

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/EduLite_Team_Trust_Task.git  
cd EduLite_Team_Trust_Task  
```

### 2. Create Your Submission Folder
#### Inside the `frontend/submissions/` folder:
```bash
mkdir <your-github-username>  
```

### 3. Build the Project

- **Use `create-react-app`, `Vite`, or any React setup.**
- **Communicate with the API using fetch or axios.**
- **Ensure your UI supports all 4 CRUD operations.**
- **The UI must reflect changes immediately (no manual refresh).**
- **You are free to organize your code with components, state management, etc.**

### 4. Create Interface Documentation

#### Inside your submission folder, create a file named:

```bash
README.md  
```
#### **In this file, include:**
- **What your UI does and which features it supports.**
- **Screenshots or screen recording (optional).**
- **Instructions to run your project locally.**
